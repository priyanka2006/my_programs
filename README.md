# my_programs
This repository contains all my work done in Python, HTML and CSS.
The project  is registering and login in to the application and for registration we
should give the details like username, email, password, login details are email and
password, when we login into the application first it will fetch the data which we have stored in our
database while registering and it will compare with the login data, if both the details are same then it will
enter into our application, the database which I have used is SQLite. 
for backend part flask is used. For rendering the template and to connect it to the server jinja2,
werkzbug is used. For validation purpose i have used wtf-forms and SQLAlchemy which is a python
SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper.
